    "# Getting started with Wordnet\n",

    "\n",
    "## Wordnet Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of Wordnet as a graph of concepts. The edges between the concepts\n",
    "describe the relationship between them. A concept node is, in fact, a set of synonyms\n",
    "representing the same concept, and is called a **Synset**. The synonyms within the\n",
    "synset are represented by their **Lemma**. A Lemma is the base form (the dictionary\n",
    "form) of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this type of structure, we are able to build mechanisms that can reason. Let’s\n",
    "take an example: I can say either “Bob drives the car” or “Bob dives the automobile”,\n",
    "both being true because the nouns “car” and “automobile” are synonyms. Also, “Bob\n",
    "drives the vehicle” can be true since all cars are vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK provides one of the best interfaces for Wordnet. It is extremely easy to use\n",
    "and before we dive into it, make this exercise: \n",
    ">**try to write down all the meanings\n",
    "of the word “car”.**\n",
