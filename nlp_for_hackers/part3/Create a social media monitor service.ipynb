    "# Part 3: Create a Social Media \n",
    "Monitoring Service\n",
    "In this third part, we’re going to talk about social media monitoring and, in\n",
    "particular, about Sentiment Analysis which is one of the most popular and widely\n",
    "used sub-branches of Natural Language Processing and Understanding.\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis means identifying the underlying affective state of a text. In\n",
    "practice, we usually talk about polarity: is the text transmitting good or bad vibes?\n",
    "The main objective of sentiment analysis is very similar to the one of text classification.\n",
    "In fact, sentiment analysis is exactly text classification with predefined\n",
    "categories such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positive / Negative\n",
    "- Positive / Neutral / Negative\n",
    "- Very-Positive / Positive / Neutral / Negative / Very-Negative\n",
    "- Objective / Subjective\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is used in various applications and the most common are:\n",
    "1. Customer Feedback Analysis (identify the polarity of user reviews)\n",
    "2. Brand Monitoring (quantify a brand’s online reputation)\n",
    "3. Analyze Political Discourse (identify political bias)\n",
    "4. Subjectivity/Objectivity Analysis (automatically label news articles for being\n",
    "not objective)\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its practical application, there are many more resources available for\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis than for general text classification, and we are going to explore\n",
    "a good deal of them in this chapter."

    "## Basics of Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned before, Sentiment Analysis represents the task of establishing if a\n",
    "certain text is positive or negative. While this task may sound pretty straightforward,\n",
    "once you get into the details of it, you might encounter some difficulties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Be Aware of Negations\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following two sentences:\n",
    "1. I like hiking very much.\n",
    "2. I don’t like hiking very much.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To a human being, these two sentences are diametrically opposed in sentiment,\n",
    "even if the only difference between them is the word “don’t”. A single negation\n",
    "might seem negligible when working with full news articles but it might have an\n",
    "important impact on the overall sentiment assessment. How would we handle this\n",
    "situation in a classic ML approach? Things can get even more complicated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- “I don’t dislike hiking.” - Double negation - Would the sentiment be positive or\n",
    "negative?\n",
    "- “I don’t like punching in the face.” Basically, I dislike a bad thing. Does that make\n",
    "the sentiment to be positive?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning doesn’t get Humour\n",
    "Let’s say you’re disappointed about a product you bought and when asked in a\n",
    "survey about it, you leave the following comment:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, sure … I’m going to buy ten more. Can’t wait! Going to the store right\n",
    "now! NOT!\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you might have felt the irony, but computer algorithms and machine learning\n",
    "models have difficulties in understanding humour and figurative speech.\n",
    "Here’s a simpler example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The experience I had at the Swan Resort Hotel was … interesting\n",
    "\n",
    "You can sense that “interesting” was used in this case with a negative connotation\n",
    "(it suggests that the person was unpleasantly surprised) rather than in its classic\n",
    "positive sense. The suspension points are an indicator of this subtlety. So, would be\n",
    "fair to say that a ML model will interpret the comment in the same way if it had\n",
    "this rule implemented (suspension points = slightly negative sense / unpleasantly\n",
    "surprised)? Would this rule be accurate? Are the suspension points generally used\n",
    "in this way? Well, no and even more, people tend to express humour and figurate\n",
    "speech in many different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple and Mixed Sentiments\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if a text expresses multiple feelings? What happens if the sentiments\n",
    "expressed are for different objects (Multiple Sentiments) and what happens if they\n",
    "are for the same object (Mixed Sentiments)? What’s the overall feeling of the text?\n",
    "These are important questions to have in mind, especially when you consider the\n",
    "practical side of Sentiment Analysis. Most of the reviews, comments, articles, etc.,\n",
    "have more than one sentence and more than one sentiment expressed towards an\n",
    "object or multiple objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following examples:\n",
    "\n",
    ">“The phone’s design is the best I’ve seen so far, but the battery can definitely\n",
    "use some improvements”\n",
    "“I know the burger is unhealthy as hell, but damn it feels good eating it!”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Which one expresses multiple sentiments and which one expresses mixed sentiments?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Verbal Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Another area where computers still fall short is non-verbal communication. The\n",
    "text we’re reading doesn’t contain any non-verbal cues. We, using experience,\n",
    "usually attribute a certain tonality to a text. Did it ever happen to fight with\n",
    "somebody in a chat application or email because you weren’t correctly interpreting\n",
    "eachother’s tone?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of what dimensions of communication can be added to a system that\n",
    "is analyzing sentiment:\n",
    " bv\n",
    "1. The Content (what is being transmitted, basically the text)\n",
    "2. The Tone (the voice inflexions, laughter, etc.)\n",
    "3. The Body Language (nodding, smiling, facial cues, gestures)\n",
    "4. Cultural Context (different cultures have different gestures)\n",
    "Can you imagine how complex a system can became if it were to take into account\n",
    "all these factors?"
